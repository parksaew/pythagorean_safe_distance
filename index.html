            <h3>So we've all heard that we need to stay 2 meters apart to be safe from people's germs...</h3>
            <br>
            <p>...however, remember that we don't live in a flat world! We live in a 3-D world with altitudes and inclines).
                Therefore, actual distance between your facial orifices and others' facial orifices does not necessarily equal the
                horizontal distance between you and the other person unless you are both the same height. Then how far should we step
                away from others to keep a safe distance efficiently? Lucky for us we have our good ol' friend pythagoras to help us!
